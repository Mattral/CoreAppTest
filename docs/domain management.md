## Domain management

The domain names for the project are managed through AWS Route 53. A white labelled site can have either/both of 2 domain names: an assigned sub-domain name and a custom domain name.

## Assigned Sub-domain name

A white-labelled site is assigned a random sub-domain name once the site is created
e.g https://lxozaq4foshfdxpwwit1pxqwdjj9g0cz_wyl763el4ku.lawonearth.org/

## Custom Domain name

A partner can add a custom domain name to their white-labelled site.
e.g https://mydomain.com
