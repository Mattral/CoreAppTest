✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Tech Stack

The projects are developed using:

- [Remix](https://remix.run/docs)
- [Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) for styling
- [Font Awesome v6](https://fontawesome.com/) for Icons
- [Saljs](https://github.com/mciastek/sal) for elements animations
- [AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)

## Project Structure

The workspace contains two apps:

- Core app [./apps/core-app](./apps/core-app/)
- Partner app [./apps/partner-app](./apps/partner-app/)

## Start the application

Run `npm run dev:core` to start the development server for the `core-app`.
Run `npm run dev:partner` to start the development server for the `partner-app`.
Happy coding!

## Deployment

The project is deployed to an EC2 instance using Github Actions. An Action is triggered on Github
when codes are pushed to any of the `dev`, `main` or `staging` branches. The `main` branch is used for
production deployment. The `staging` branch is meant for stable but `not production` deployments.

## Build for production

Github Actions is used in building the app for any of the deployment environment

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).
